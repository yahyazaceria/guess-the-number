# Guess The Number! 


## Description ↓

Hello coders 🧑🏼‍💻, this is a script where you have to continually 🔄 guess 🔮 a number between ① & 💯 to figure out the computer's number. 

The computer will tell you whether your guess is too high 👆 or low 👇, until you get it right. Once you get it right, the program will tell you how many guesses it took. 

So go ahead and run guess.py 🐍 to play for yourself right now❗️
