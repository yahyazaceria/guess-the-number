# Guess The Number!


## Description

Hello coders, this is a script where you have to continually guess a number between 1 & 100 to figure out the computer's number. 

The computer will tell you whether your guess is too high or low, until you get it right. Once you get it right, the program will tell you how many guesses it took.

So go ahead and run guess.py to play for yourself right now.
